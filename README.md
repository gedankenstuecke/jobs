# Open Postdoc Position at CRI Paris

The Peer-Produced Research Lab group from CRI (INSERM U1284) is hiring a 2-year post-doc, working with Bastian Greshake Tzovaras. Start date: July - Sept 2020.

We are looking for a post-doctoral fellow to work on a multi-disciplinary project studying the implementation of commons-based peer production (decentralized and cooperative knowledge production) in citizen science. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the parameters for successfully implementing commons-based peer production to enable the bottom-up creation of citizen science projects out of disparate communities of interest and scaling up personal n=1 experiments. We are especially interested in exploring how digitally mediated interactions can lead to new forms of interactions and empower individuals in these settings. 

The ideal candidate has a background in the social sciences and brings some prior experience with investigating communities or working on citizen science or peer-produced projects (e.g. open source, Wikipedia etc.). 
The candidate should have a PhD as well as at least one peer-reviewed publication as main author in either of the following disciplines: communication studies, (political) economy, information sciences, computer science, natural sciences, psychology, computational social sciences, sociology or a different discipline which would allow them to contribute to projects related to:

- Citizen/community science: invite participants to become a researcher for their own experiments and consider their lives as a research lab for conducting daily experiments.
- Theory building: develop frameworks for how lessons on commons-based peer production from a variety of other fields could be translated to citizen/community science
- Action Research: maximize participation in community science projects, taking into account the contexts and limitations of the community 
- Evidence-based research: Identify "what works" and "what doesn't work" when trying to implement hallmarks of commons-based peer production in a citizen science setting, using qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies.

More information about the research activities of the Peer-Produced Research Lab group can be found [on our website](https://research.cri-paris.org/teampage?id=5d809b499a474e063faa3a1a) and [our larger research proposal](proposal_details.pdf)).

The successful candidate will join the CRIâ€™s growing [Collaboratory](https://research.cri-paris.org/) within our dedicated building at the historical heart of Paris (the Marais). This 5300m2 building includes state-of-the-art office and wet-lab space, microfabrication and Makerspace, Mobile and Virtual Reality technology, Game design, MOOC/online content development, pedagogic facilities and studio apartments for students and young researchers.
The core mission of the [Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI)](https://cri-paris.org/) is to transform the way to research and acquire, share and co-create knowledge across the life, learning, and digital sciences. We are guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals towards high-impact work on specific topics combining biomedicine, natural sciences, education, and digital transformation. 

**Application**: Candidates should send their CV including their publication list, a brief statement of research interests, and contact details of two referees before March 15th 2020 to Bastian Greshake Tzovaras [bastian.greshake-tzovaras@cri-paris.org](mailto:bastian.greshake-tzovaras@cri-paris.org) Informal inquiries are welcome.
